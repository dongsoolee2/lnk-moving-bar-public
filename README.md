# Linear-Nonlinear-Kinetics (LNK) model for moving bar experiments

To explain the nonlinear predictive shift in neural transmission, a
computational model of synaptic depression was built (Ozuysal & Baccus, 2012;
Ozuysal, Kastner & Baccus, 2018).

The linear-nonlinear-kinetic (LNK) model consists of a linear temporal filter
representing stages prior to the synapse, a static nonlinearity that represents
the threshold at the presynaptic terminal, followed by a first-order kinetic
model (reduced Hidden Markov Model) to represent the dynamics of synaptic
release including depression.
